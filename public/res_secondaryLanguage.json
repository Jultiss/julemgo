    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Julien Tissidre. I'm 44 years old, a father of 2 children aged 11 and 6, and I live in Agen, Nouvelle Aquitaine. I work as a senior manager at a regional bank, where I hold the position of Head of Credit Production. I joined this wonderful company at the age of 18 and completed all my studies there through apprenticeships and internal programs (ITB, Kedge). I've worked in almost all roles in the branches, then transitioned to a role as the manager of an online branch before creating an online consumer credit distribution platform. For the past 4 years, I've been responsible for the Credit expert teams (back and middle office). I've just completed the diploma program in Web Development at OpenClassrooms. It's more of a personal challenge than a professional one, and I see this training as an opportunity to better understand this field that I'm passionate about!... and who knows... maybe even more... The future belongs to those who dare...!",
